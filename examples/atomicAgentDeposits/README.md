Encode Finance deposits from Agent
==================================

Send multiple finance deposits with just one vote! This is an advanced script
to send funds to many different Finance apps. If you need to send multiple
transactions to normal ethereum addresses, please, use the
[Atomic Payments](../atomicPayments) example.

## Usage
1. Change `payments.json` data to include the addresses 
for your DAO, voting and agent apps and the list of 
payments you want make (receive).
2. Execute `node index.js | sh` to run the command.
3. If successful, open your DAO and vote in the new vote.
