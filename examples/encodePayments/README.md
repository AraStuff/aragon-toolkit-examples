Encode payments
===============

Do many transactions with just one voting.

## Usage
1. Change `payments.json` data. Set up the DAO, voting and finance apps, and the
list of payments you want do.
2. Execute `node index.js | sh` to run the command.
3. On successful, open your DAO and see the new vote.
